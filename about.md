### About Me

Hello there! My name is Connor Moreside. I am a full stack developer currently based out of London, England. Over the past couple of years, I have primarily been working with the .NET / C# stack, developing enterprise applications for various large companies.
  
I am also a strong proponent of [civic technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_technology), and more specifically civic tech which utilizes [open data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data). The vastmajority of my open source applications are built around open datasets provided bygovernment organizations. I volunteer for a group called [Beta CityYEG](https://betacity.ca), which is a local civic tech group devoted to "connecting public employees, citizens, and members of Edmonton's tech /data community in order to address the city and region's pressing issues." Here is my [latest contribution](https://betacity.ca/2015/12/20/yeg-historical-photo-mappig/) to the group.
  
When I am coding for fun, I enjoy working in a variety of languages. I am presently using Python, Haskell, and Node.js in my miscellaneous side projects. Out of those 3 languages listed, Haskell is my favourite! I typically find that if my Haskell code compiles,there is a high probability that it functions as intended ;)
